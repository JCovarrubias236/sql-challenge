# SQL Challenge
This repository will be used for the Module 9 SQL challenge.

## Description

For this SQL challenge, I completed a research project about people that a fictitious company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. The data I used for this project is contained in six CSV files. First, I designed six tables by creating an ERD to hold the data from the CSV files. This is where I specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and composite keys. Then I imported the CSV files into a SQL database contained with PostgreSQL. Lastly, I completed eight queries to answer eight questions about the data. Through the completion of this project, I demonstrated my knowledge and skills in data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Installation

Feel free to download the CSV files and the SQL files I provided to look over and run the SQL script in your SQL database program.

Feel free to download PostgreSQL so you can mimic the actions that I took to complete this project. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. Please see the below link to download PostgreSQL:
